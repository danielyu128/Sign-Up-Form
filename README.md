Sign-Up Form Project

Course: Intermediate HTML & CSS
Assignment: Design and implement a sign-up form for an imaginary service.

üìù Overview

This project involves creating a responsive (well, desktop-first) signup page which:

Uses semantic HTML to build the layout (logo section, form section, image sidebar).
